    "## 3. State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "State management is an essential concept when working with agents. The \"state\" of an agent refers to its current condition or the information it has at any given time. For instance, if an agent is working through a list of tasks, its state might include which tasks have been completed, which are in progress, and which are yet to be started. Without proper state management, an agent might lose track of its progress, repeat tasks, or skip important steps. In this notebook, you'll learn how to manage an agent's state effectively, ensuring that it operates smoothly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement state management for our ReAct agent, we define a structured data model (`AgentGraphState`) that holds all the relevant information the agent needs to function effectively. This model includes:\n",
    "- **Input:** The current command or task that the agent is working on.\n",
    "- **Response:** The outputs or actions the agent has generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we provide a utility function, `update_state`, which allows for updating specific elements of the agent's state. This function ensures that the state is consistently and accurately maintained, which is critical for the agent to operate effectively. By checking for the existence of keys before updating, the function helps prevent errors and maintains the integrity of the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these components form the backbone of the agent's state management system, enabling it to manage complex workflows and adapt to changes dynamically."
