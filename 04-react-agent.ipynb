    "# Building a Project Manager (PM) Agent for VM Migration in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to build and deploy a Project Manager (PM) agent designed to manage the execution of a Virtual Machine (VM) migration plan. This agent will coordinate various tasks, monitor progress, and dynamically adapt the plan based on feedback from different engineering agents. By the end of this notebook, you will understand how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up and configure a model to support the PM agent's decision-making process.\n",
    "- Define and manage the state for the PM agent to track task progress and dependencies.\n",
    "- Implement and customize the PM agent to handle specific responsibilities within the VM migration workflow.\n",
    "- Construct and compile a workflow graph to represent the PM agentâ€™s interactions with other agents.\n",
    "- Execute the workflow, manage outputs, and handle dynamic adjustments to the plan based on real-time feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the implementation, it's essential to understand some basic concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PM Agent:** A specialized agent that autonomously manages the execution of a VM migration plan. The PM agent coordinates tasks, assigns responsibilities to other agents (e.g., OCP Engineer, vSphere Engineer), and tracks the overall progress of the migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State:** A shared data structure that stores the context, task statuses, dependencies, and other critical information required by the PM agent. Effective state management ensures that the PM agent can track progress, handle feedback, and adapt the plan as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VM Migration Plan:** A structured set of tasks required to move virtual machines from one environment to another. The PM agent will break down the migration plan into individual tasks, assign them to the appropriate agents, and ensure they are executed in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Workflow Graph:** A structured representation of the PM agent's workflow, where nodes represent tasks or decisions, and edges define the flow of control between these steps. This graph helps visualize and manage the sequence of actions during the VM migration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback Handling:** The process by which the PM agent receives and processes feedback from other agents (e.g., task completion, errors, or issues) and adapts the migration plan accordingly to ensure a smooth execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering:** The process of crafting prompts that guide the PM agent's interaction with the model. Proper prompt engineering ensures that the agent generates relevant and accurate tasks and adjustments to the migration plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts will provide a solid foundation as we proceed with the practical implementation of the PM agent and its role in managing a VM migration plan.\n"

    "## 5. State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "State management is an essential concept when working with agents. The \"state\" of an agent refers to its current condition or the information it has at any given time. For instance, if an agent is working through a list of tasks, its state might include which tasks have been completed, which are in progress, and which are yet to be started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing this state is crucial because it allows the agent to keep track of what it has done and what it needs to do next. Without proper state management, an agent might lose track of its progress, repeat tasks, or skip important steps. In this notebook, you'll learn how to manage an agent's state effectively, ensuring that it operates smoothly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement state management for our PM agent, we define a structured data model (`AgentGraphState`) that holds all the relevant information the agent needs to function effectively. This model includes:\n",
    "- **Input:** The current command or task that the agent is working on.\n",
    "- **Response:** The outputs or actions the agent has generated.\n",
    "- **Feedback:** Any feedback received from other agents or parts of the system.\n",
    "- **Validation Status:** A flag indicating whether the agent's output has been validated, ensuring that all tasks meet the required criteria before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we provide a utility function, `update_state`, which allows for updating specific elements of the agent's state. This function ensures that the state is consistently and accurately maintained, which is critical for the agent to operate effectively. By checking for the existence of keys before updating, the function helps prevent errors and maintains the integrity of the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these components form the backbone of the agent's state management system, enabling it to manage complex workflows and adapt to changes dynamically."

    "## 6. What is an Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an agent is a program that can perform tasks autonomously based on a set of instructions. Think of an agent as a virtual assistant that can handle specific jobs for you. For example, in the context of data science or software development, an agent might process data, make decisions based on that data, and then carry out actions like sending requests or updating records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are often designed to work without constant human intervention. Once you give them the initial instructions, they can execute tasks on their own, making them very useful in automating repetitive or complex processes."

    "### System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "System prompts are predefined instructions provided to large language models (LLMs) that guide the AI's behavior during interactions. They set the context, define the role of the AI, and establish rules for how the model should respond to user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "System prompts are essential for ensuring that an AI model like our PM agent performs its tasks consistently and effectively. By specifying the role, task guidelines, and response format, the system prompt helps the AI maintain focus on its objectivesâ€”in this case, managing a VM migration plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How They Work\n",
    "\n",
    "When the PM agent receives a query, the system prompt shapes how it processes the input and generates its output. This includes breaking down tasks, assigning them to the correct agents, and handling feedbackâ€”all within the structure provided by the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, system prompts are a powerful tool that directs AI behavior, ensuring responses are aligned with the desired goals and context.\n"
