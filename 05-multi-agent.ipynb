    "# 04: Building a Multi-Agent Workflow with StateGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to build a multi-agent workflow using **LangGraph's StateGraph**. A **StateGraph** allows agents to communicate through a shared state, enabling them to collaborate on complex tasks. Each node in the graph performs an action, reads from the shared state, and writes results back to it, forming a seamless workflow between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a shared state schema for agent communication.\n",
    "- Build and compile a `StateGraph` where nodes represent agents or actions.\n",
    "- Use multi-agent workflows to solve more complex tasks by aggregating results across different agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to StateGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "A `StateGraph` is a graph structure where each node represents an action or a task that modifies a shared state. The state is passed between nodes, allowing each node (or agent) to update it with partial results. You can think of it as a chain of actions, where each action contributes to solving a larger problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents working together to solve a problem by performing different tasks, each contributing to the final solution.\n",
    "- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Complex workflows where each node processes and transforms data, passing the results to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on building such a workflow and demonstrate how agents can communicate by reading from and writing to the shared state."
