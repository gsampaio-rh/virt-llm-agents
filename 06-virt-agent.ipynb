    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an AI-powered workflow agent that interacts with vSphere, lists available virtual machines (VMs), retrieves their details, and processes commands using a machine learning model. The agent also integrates with custom tools and persists workflow data using SQLite. Each step is carefully broken down, and instructions are provided for users who may be new to the components involved."
