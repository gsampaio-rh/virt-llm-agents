    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an AI-powered multi-agent workflow that interacts with **Virtual Machines (VMs)** and **OpenShift**. The agents process tasks such as listing VMs, retrieving VM details, and managing OpenShift migration plans using custom tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging a machine learning model, the agents are able to process natural language instructions and execute specific tasks. The workflow is designed to be flexible, allowing different agents to collaborate through a shared state, with task data being persisted using **SQLite**."
